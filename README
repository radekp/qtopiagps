This is a port of xgps from the gpsd distribution to Qtopia for the Freerunner.
UPDATED to run on qtmoko AKA Qt Extended.

More info can be found at http://blog.wolfman.com/articles/2008/08/27/porting-xgps-to-qtopia-for-the-freerunner

To build you need the Trolltech toolchain.

> cd qtopiagps
> $QPEDIR/bin/qbuild

If you don't have libgps in the toolchain then detar the libgps-dev.tar.gz
into the toolchain
> cd /
> tar xvfz libgps-dev.tar.gz

it will go into /opt/toolchains/arm920t-eabi/arm-angstrom-linux-gnueabi/usr/lib/...
