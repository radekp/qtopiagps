This is a port of xgps from the gpsd distribution to Qtopia for the Freerunner.
UPDATED to run on qtmoko AKA Qt Extended.

More info can be found at http://blog.wolfman.com/articles/2008/08/27/porting-xgps-to-qtopia-for-the-freerunner

To build you need the Trolltech toolchain.

> cd qtopiagps
> $QPEDIR/bin/qbuild

If you don't have libgps in the toolchain then detar the libgps-dev.tar.gz
into the toolchain
> cd /
> tar xvfz libgps-dev.tar.gz

it will go into /opt/toolchains/arm920t-eabi/arm-angstrom-linux-gnueabi/usr/lib/...

On QTMoko you need to edit /etc/default/gpsd to the following...

# Default settings for gpsd.
# Please do not edit this file directly - use `dpkg-reconfigure gpsd' to
# change the options.
START_DAEMON="true"
DAEMON_OPTS=""
DEVICES="/dev/ttySAC1"
USBAUTO="false"

then you can do this to start gpsd...

> /etc/init.d/gpsd start

Then you can run qtopiagps

TODO
====

1. I plan on removing the dependency on gpsd, and use the builtin Location API of Qt.
2. I want to add simple tracking, and pedometer type functions.
