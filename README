This is a port of xgps from the gpsd distribution to Qtopia for the Freerunner.

More info can be found at http://blog.wolfman.com/articles/2008/08/27/porting-xgps-to-qtopia-for-the-freerunner

To build you need the Trolltech toolchain.

> cd qtopiagps
> $QPEDIR/bin/qtopiamake
> make

If you don't have libgps in the toolchain then detar the libgps.tar.gz
into the toolchain, by default this is /opt/toolchain and the libs go in usr/lib
